       labels(dependent) as DependentType, labels(dependency) as DependencyType
```

#### 15. Method Calls
```cypher
MATCH (caller)-[:CALLS]->(method:Function) 
RETURN caller.id as Caller, method.id as Method, labels(caller) as CallerType
```
*Shows method call relationships*

### **Advanced Exploration Queries**

#### 16. Pattern Classification
```cypher
MATCH (n:Class) 
RETURN n.id as ClassName, 
       CASE 
         WHEN n.id CONTAINS 'Adapter' THEN 'Adapter Pattern'
         WHEN n.id CONTAINS 'Blacksmith' THEN 'Factory Pattern'
         WHEN n.id CONTAINS 'Observer' THEN 'Observer Pattern'
         WHEN n.id CONTAINS 'Strategy' THEN 'Strategy Pattern'
         WHEN n.id CONTAINS 'Decorator' THEN 'Decorator Pattern'
         WHEN n.id CONTAINS 'Singleton' THEN 'Singleton Pattern'
         ELSE 'Other'
       END as Pattern
ORDER BY Pattern, ClassName
```
*Categorizes classes by design pattern*

#### 17. Node Properties Inspection
```cypher
MATCH (n) WHERE n.id IS NOT NULL 
RETURN labels(n) as NodeType, keys(n) as Properties, n.id as ID 
LIMIT 10
```
*Shows the structure and properties of nodes*

#### 18. Full Graph Overview
```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r]-(m) RETURN n, r, m LIMIT 50
```
*Shows a comprehensive view of the graph structure*

#### 19. Find Isolated Nodes
```cypher
MATCH (n) 
WHERE NOT (n)-[]-() 
RETURN n.id as IsolatedNode, labels(n) as NodeType
```
*Finds nodes with no relationships*

#### 20. Complex Relationship Paths
```cypher
MATCH path = (start:Class)-[*2..3]-(end:Class)
WHERE start.id <> end.id
RETURN start.id as StartClass, end.id as EndClass, length(path) as PathLength
LIMIT 10
```
*Finds complex relationship paths between classes*

## üí° **Neo4j Browser Tips**

### **Navigation Tips:**
- **Click on nodes** to see their properties in the sidebar
- **Double-click nodes** to expand their immediate neighbors
- **Click and drag** to move nodes around
- **Use mouse wheel** to zoom in/out
- **Right-click** for context menus

### **Visualization Tips:**
- **Try different layouts**: Force-directed, Hierarchical, Grid
- **Use node colors** to distinguish different node types
- **Adjust node sizes** based on properties or relationships
- **Use filters** to focus on specific node types or relationships

### **Query Tips:**
- **Use LIMIT** to avoid overwhelming results
- **Use WHERE clauses** to filter results
- **Use ORDER BY** to sort results
- **Save frequently used queries** as favorites
- **Use EXPLAIN** to understand query performance

### **Export Options:**
- **Export as PNG/SVG** for documentation
- **Export as JSON** for data analysis
- **Export as CSV** for spreadsheet analysis
- **Copy query results** to clipboard

## üîç **What to Look For**

### **In Design Patterns:**
- **Inheritance hierarchies** showing abstract classes and concrete implementations
- **Interface implementations** showing contracts and their implementations
- **Composition relationships** showing how objects contain other objects
- **Dependency relationships** showing how classes depend on each other

### **In Spring Pet Clinic:**
- **Entity relationships** between domain objects
- **Service layer dependencies** 
- **Controller mappings** and their dependencies
- **Repository patterns** and data access

### **General Code Structure:**
- **Package organization** and module boundaries
- **Method call patterns** and interaction flows
- **Cross-cutting concerns** like logging, validation
- **Architectural patterns** and their implementations

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

1. **Start with basic queries** (#1-4) to understand the overall structure
2. **Explore specific patterns** (#11-13) if you generated design patterns
3. **Analyze relationships** (#8-9, #14-15) to understand code dependencies
4. **Use visualization** to see patterns and structures visually
5. **Experiment** with your own queries based on what you find

The Neo4j Browser is a powerful tool for exploring and understanding your codebase's structure and relationships!
