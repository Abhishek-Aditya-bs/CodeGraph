# Vector Index Visualization Guide

## 🔍 **What Gets Stored in Neo4j After Vector Index Creation**

When you run the vector index test, here's exactly what gets created in your Neo4j database:

### **1. 🔵 CodeChunk Nodes (The Main Vector Nodes)**

Each code chunk becomes a `CodeChunk` node with these properties:

```cypher
-- View CodeChunk nodes with all their properties
MATCH (c:CodeChunk)
RETURN c.text, c.file_path, c.chunk_id, c.language, 
       c.start_line, c.end_line, c.embedding
LIMIT 3
```

**What you'll see:**
- `text`: The actual code content (string)
- `file_path`: Full path to the source file
- `chunk_id`: Unique identifier for this chunk
- `language`: Programming language (java, python, etc.)
- `start_line`, `end_line`: Line numbers in original file
- `embedding`: **3072-dimensional vector array** (the actual embeddings!)

### **2. 📁 File Nodes (Metadata Nodes)**

Each source file becomes a `File` node:

```cypher
-- View File nodes with metadata
MATCH (f:File)
RETURN f.path, f.name, f.extension, f.language, 
       f.total_chunks, f.total_lines, f.created_at
LIMIT 5
```

**What you'll see:**
- `path`: Full file path
- `name`: Just the filename
- `extension`: File extension (.java, .py)
- `language`: Programming language
- `total_chunks`: How many chunks this file was split into
- `total_lines`: Total lines in the original file
- `created_at`: When this was created

### **3. 🔗 Relationships**

Files are linked to their code chunks:

```cypher
-- View the file-to-chunk relationships
MATCH (f:File)-[r:CONTAINS_CHUNK]->(c:CodeChunk)
RETURN f.name, c.chunk_id, c.start_line, c.end_line
LIMIT 10
```

## 🎯 **Vector Index Visualization Queries**

### **Query 1: See the Actual Embeddings**
```cypher
-- View the actual vector embeddings (first few dimensions)
MATCH (c:CodeChunk)
RETURN c.file_path, 
       c.text[0..100] + "..." as code_preview,
       c.embedding[0..5] as first_6_dimensions,
       size(c.embedding) as embedding_size
LIMIT 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
file_path: "cloned_repos/java-design-patterns/adapter/src/main/java/..."
code_preview: "public class FishingBoatAdapter implements RowingBoat {..."
first_6_dimensions: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, -0.234, 0.567, -0.890]
embedding_size: 3072
```

### **Query 2: File Structure Overview**
```cypher
-- See how files are chunked
MATCH (f:File)-[:CONTAINS_CHUNK]->(c:CodeChunk)
RETURN f.name, 
       f.total_chunks,
       collect(c.start_line + "-" + c.end_line) as chunk_ranges
ORDER BY f.total_chunks DESC
```

### **Query 3: Vector Index Statistics**
```cypher
-- Get comprehensive statistics
MATCH (c:CodeChunk)
WITH count(c) as total_chunks,
     collect(DISTINCT c.language) as languages,
     collect(DISTINCT c.file_path) as files
MATCH (f:File)
WITH total_chunks, languages, files, count(f) as total_files
RETURN total_chunks, total_files, languages, size(files) as unique_files
```

### **Query 4: Check Vector Index Exists**
```cypher
-- Verify the vector index was created
SHOW INDEXES
YIELD name, type, labelsOrTypes, properties
WHERE name = 'code_chunks_vector_index'
```

## 🔍 **Understanding the Embeddings**

### **What Are Embeddings?**
- **3072-dimensional vectors** (arrays of 3072 floating-point numbers)
- Each dimension captures semantic meaning
- Similar code chunks have similar vectors
- Generated by OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model

### **Example Embedding Structure:**
```
[0.123, -0.456, 0.789, -0.234, 0.567, -0.890, ..., 0.345]
 ^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^            ^
 dim1    dim2    dim3    dim4    dim5    dim6      dim3072
```

### **How Similarity Works:**
```cypher
-- This is conceptually how vector search works
-- (Neo4j does this automatically with the vector index)

-- 1. Query: "adapter pattern"
-- 2. Convert to embedding: [0.1, -0.2, 0.3, ...]
-- 3. Compare to all stored embeddings using cosine similarity
-- 4. Return most similar chunks
```

## 🧪 **Testing Vector Search Manually**

You can test the vector search directly in Neo4j Browser:

### **Method 1: Using db.index.vector.queryNodes**
```cypher
-- Search for code similar to "adapter pattern implementation"
-- (This requires the embedding of your query - normally done by the application)
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('code_chunks_vector_index', 5, $queryEmbedding)
YIELD node, score
RETURN node.text[0..200] as code_preview, 
       node.file_path, 
       score
```

### **Method 2: Text-based Search (Fallback)**
```cypher
-- Simple text search as fallback
MATCH (c:CodeChunk)
WHERE toLower(c.text) CONTAINS "adapter"
RETURN c.file_path, c.text[0..200] as preview, c.start_line
LIMIT 5
```

## 📊 **What the Test Actually Does**

When you run `python tests/test_vector_index.py`, it:

1. **Creates embeddings** for ~10-15 code chunks
2. **Stores them** as CodeChunk nodes with 3072-dimensional vectors
3. **Creates File metadata** nodes
4. **Links everything** with relationships
5. **Tests search** with queries like "adapter pattern implementation"
6. **Returns results** with similarity scores

## 🌟 **Cool Things You Can Explore**

### **1. Find Similar Code Patterns**
```cypher
-- Find all chunks from the same file
MATCH (f:File {name: "FishingBoatAdapter.java"})-[:CONTAINS_CHUNK]->(c:CodeChunk)
RETURN c.text, c.start_line, c.end_line
```

### **2. Language Distribution**
```cypher
-- See what languages are in your vector index
MATCH (c:CodeChunk)
RETURN c.language, count(c) as chunk_count
ORDER BY chunk_count DESC
```

### **3. Largest Code Chunks**
```cypher
-- Find the largest code chunks
MATCH (c:CodeChunk)
RETURN c.file_path, 
       size(c.text) as text_length,
       c.start_line, c.end_line
ORDER BY text_length DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## 💡 **Key Insights**

- **Yes, embeddings are fully stored** in Neo4j as 3072-dimensional arrays
- **Rich metadata** makes the chunks searchable and traceable
- **Vector search** finds semantically similar code, not just keyword matches
- **Hybrid approach** combines graph relationships with vector similarity
- **Scalable design** can handle large codebases with thousands of chunks

The vector index creates a **semantic search engine** for your code that understands meaning, not just text matches!
